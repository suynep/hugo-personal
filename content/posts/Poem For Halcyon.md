# For Bhargo, and a date

sky blushes in the faintest pink imaginable

with you lying there.

i interlock my fingers,

mustering the courage to speak.

"this is nostalgic"

"we shouldn't talk about it, suy"

"..."

*how do i tell you how much i miss you, and your presence*

miss with eyes that gaze like a serene pond

i love y-the reflections in your eyes.

the way you see

i'm never this soft, but you, miss,

who are you, who always take me homeward?


*i like you*

*i can't say the stronger word*

...

# Tale of A Reminiscence Magnifique

My *silent nights* carry words for you

sometimes

like tonight.

You, Mahjabeen, the *moon faced one*,

were just Mahjabeen to me, a distant body

dangling in space;

tonight though, you're the entirety of everything

in every form and manifest.


Perhaps, my life is a chase to know you.


I relate to a hero somewhere: a hero obsessed with

the thought of his lover, who was once his dearest.

His days pass with the practice of his sacred art,

and his nights with the unquenchable thirst for his amore, his

life's

strength.

Love gives me strength.

You, my love, give me strength.

Shakti, as east calls it. 

You, are my shakti and, if i daresay,

my bhakti: a devotion transcending space and time.

Though I've recognized how I can,

through the magic of counting,

pull your sixty, 

add up to my eighty, and 

make you fall slightly harder than before,

I cannot pull your physical.

Cannot seem to pull your tongue by mine.

You eat me. always the mightiest of bites you take.

I long, and long, but my self

is smaller than small. 

for you, and for me, i can grow tall though.

but maybe right now it should be about me and only me.

Because halcyon, for what it always is, was and will be, is 

ephemeral. You, amore, were always a mayfly. May fly. A w a y. 

the only constant.

So, let me be, please. 

let my turmoil grow into a storm, and let me pass. 

I'll slither through the crevices of your heart and find my way out

for my belief in time grounds this heart, which, like you, always flies. 

*Mr Surefly*.
