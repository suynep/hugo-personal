# On Inferiority Complex, and Why I always feel like I lack

Anxiety is a strange demon. Laziness stands somewhere in the same pedestal for me. These two cling to my back like a two year old does his momma, and my sad soul has never ever been able to get rid of them in the slightest. Why though...? What would it take for me to change?

Determination? Not enough. Indulging myself in distractions that pertain to academia, but fruitless nevertheless? Pointless. I'm stuck. STOK.

This makes me feel inferior more than anything. Makes me compare me to others instead of myself. This is diabolic. This mind-state kills. Please Suy, work something out.

# On Religion, Spirituality, and Life: from the views of a blooming sun

If I told you I'm Religious, you'll laugh. If I, however, tell you that I'm Spiritual, you will hold me in a higher pedestal. The difference in terminology, though distinct, isn't totally disjoint in the aspect of conveyance. I'd say both religiosity, and spirituality are two faces of the same coin. The coin of metaphysics and it's abstractions. Shambhu Bholanath Yogi Mahadeva? What am I listening to? Raga Adana. Beautiful bhajana.


# What ought I do?

You see, I love building things. Digital things. Because the computer seldom limits me in any form and feature. For this sole reason, I refrain from playing games and indulging myself in activities that other consider normal, or recreational. I want to build and build and build and hopefully, someday, with the allowance of fate and future, fly. I love typing as well. I love programming as well, and I've perhaps found a new hobby. Golang. But I want to monetize my skills in this aspect. Earn a few just so I won't have to bear this hunger that I feel from time to time. I wish fate would help me. But I would be asking too much with too little to show. For the same reason, I wish to upskill myself. Become a programming god. Create what I think, and create 'em goood.

Thoughts of past lovers remain an apparition in my head. They aren't present in my life, only in this silly brain.

I'm listening to a beautiful song. `Helios` by Haruka Nakamura. 
"...you were born from the sky,
Helios..."

Am I too a part of this cosmic dance? Of the eternal sky? Perhaps. I like to think I am. To give this tiny heart little optimism in life.

Maybe I am, ey?

Hee hee.

# Pondering on a rainy night, in a space filled with your scent.

Heavens bless this heart of mine, for it longs for you when enveloped in the trenches of solitude. I love you, gal. Silly.
