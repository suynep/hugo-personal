# About Moi

What the internet allows is a space. A space to spew anything and everything. This is *my space* to spew. Welcome. Come see how much this seemingly unyappy chap can yap.


I'm Suy. I love tinkering around with tech, building stuff. I lovee computers in general. If you're a sucker for computers, well, bad news. I suck more. Hehe.

From scouring thru pages on pages from [HackerNews](https://hackernews.com) to [Aeon](https://aeon.co) to [Psyche](https://psyche.co), you'll mostly find me buried in piles of words. Words are beautiful. Humans, who are made of words, lie at the epitome of god's creation.
