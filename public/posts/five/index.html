<p>Anxiety is a strange demon. Laziness stands somewhere in the same pedestal for me. These two cling to my back like a two year old does his momma, and my sad soul has never ever been able to get rid of them in the slightest. Why though&hellip;? What would it take for me to change?</p>
<p>Determination? Not enough. Indulging myself in distractions that pertain to academia, but fruitless nevertheless? Pointless. I&rsquo;m stuck. STOK.</p>
<p>This makes me feel inferior more than anything. Makes me compare me to others instead of myself. This is diabolic. This mind-state kills. Please Suy, work something out.</p>

<p>If I told you I&rsquo;m Religious, you&rsquo;ll laugh. If I, however, tell you that I&rsquo;m Spiritual, you will hold me in a higher pedestal. The difference in terminology, though distinct, isn&rsquo;t totally disjoint in the aspect of conveyance. I&rsquo;d say both religiosity, and spirituality are two faces of the same coin. The coin of metaphysics and it&rsquo;s abstractions. Shambhu Bholanath Yogi Mahadeva? What am I listening to? Raga Adana. Beautiful bhajana.</p>

<p>You see, I love building things. Digital things. Because the computer seldom limits me in any form and feature. For this sole reason, I refrain from playing games and indulging myself in activities that other consider normal, or recreational. I want to build and build and build and hopefully, someday, with the allowance of fate and future, fly. I love typing as well. I love programming as well, and I&rsquo;ve perhaps found a new hobby. Golang. But I want to monetize my skills in this aspect. Earn a few just so I won&rsquo;t have to bear this hunger that I feel from time to time. I wish fate would help me. But I would be asking too much with too little to show. For the same reason, I wish to upskill myself. Become a programming god. Create what I think, and create &rsquo;em goood.</p>
<p>Thoughts of past lovers remain an apparition in my head. They aren&rsquo;t present in my life, only in this silly brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to a beautiful song. <code>Helios</code> by Haruka Nakamura.
&ldquo;&hellip;you were born from the sky,
Helios&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Am I too a part of this cosmic dance? Of the eternal sky? Perhaps. I like to think I am. To give this tiny heart little optimism in life.</p>
<p>Maybe I am, ey?</p>
<p>Hee hee.</p>

<p>Heavens bless this heart of mine, for it longs for you when enveloped in the trenches of solitude. I love you, gal. Silly.</p>
