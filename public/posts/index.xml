&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Suy. I love tinkering around with tech, building stuff and computers in general. If you&amp;rsquo;re a sucker for computers, well, bad news. I suck more. Hehe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-inferiority-complex-and-why-i-always-feel-like-i-lack&#34;&gt;On Inferiority Complex, and Why I always feel like I lack&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is a strange demon. Laziness stands somewhere in the same pedestal for me. These two cling to my back like a two year old does his momma, and my sad soul has never ever been able to get rid of them in the slightest. Why though&amp;hellip;? What would it take for me to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determination? Not enough. Indulging myself in distractions that pertain to academia, but fruitless nevertheless? Pointless. I&amp;rsquo;m stuck. STOK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is a strange demon. Laziness stands somewhere in the same pedestal for me. These two cling to my back like a two year old does his momma, and my sad soul has never ever been able to get rid of them in the slightest. Why though&amp;hellip;? What would it take for me to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determination? Not enough. Indulging myself in distractions that pertain to academia, but fruitless nevertheless? Pointless. I&amp;rsquo;m stuck. STOK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me feel inferior more than anything. Makes me compare me to others instead of myself. This is diabolic. This mind-state kills. Please Suy, work something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-religion-spirituality-and-life-from-the-views-of-a-blooming-sun&#34;&gt;On Religion, Spirituality, and Life: from the views of a blooming sun&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I told you I&amp;rsquo;m Religious, you&amp;rsquo;ll laugh. If I, however, tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m Spiritual, you will hold me in a higher pedestal. The difference in terminology, though distinct, isn&amp;rsquo;t totally disjoint in the aspect of conveyance. I&amp;rsquo;d say both religiosity, and spirituality are two faces of the same coin. The coin of metaphysics and it&amp;rsquo;s abstractions. Shambhu Bholanath Yogi Mahadeva? What am I listening to? Raga Adana. Beautiful bhajana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-ought-i-do&#34;&gt;What ought I do?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I love building things. Digital things. Because the computer seldom limits me in any form and feature. For this sole reason, I refrain from playing games and indulging myself in activities that other consider normal, or recreational. I want to build and build and build and hopefully, someday, with the allowance of fate and future, fly. I love typing as well. I love programming as well, and I&amp;rsquo;ve perhaps found a new hobby. Golang. But I want to monetize my skills in this aspect. Earn a few just so I won&amp;rsquo;t have to bear this hunger that I feel from time to time. I wish fate would help me. But I would be asking too much with too little to show. For the same reason, I wish to upskill myself. Become a programming god. Create what I think, and create &amp;rsquo;em goood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts of past lovers remain an apparition in my head. They aren&amp;rsquo;t present in my life, only in this silly brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m listening to a beautiful song. &lt;code&gt;Helios&lt;/code&gt; by Haruka Nakamura.
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;you were born from the sky,
Helios&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I too a part of this cosmic dance? Of the eternal sky? Perhaps. I like to think I am. To give this tiny heart little optimism in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am, ey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hee hee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pondering-on-a-rainy-night-in-a-space-filled-with-your-scent&#34;&gt;Pondering on a rainy night, in a space filled with your scent.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavens bless this heart of mine, for it longs for you when enveloped in the trenches of solitude. I love you, gal. Silly.&lt;/p&gt;
